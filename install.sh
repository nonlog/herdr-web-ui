# herdr web ui in one line, from a PC that may have none of it yet:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://devswha.github.io/herdr-web-ui/install.sh | sh
#
# 1. Installs what is missing, for this user only and without sudo: herdr (its own installer, into
#    ~/.local/bin), Bun (its own installer, into ~/.bun) and Node 22 (the official build, checked
#    against its published SHA-256, into ~/.local/share/herdr-web-ui/node).
# 2. Installs herdr web ui as a herdr plugin, so it starts with herdr and Settings → Updates keeps it
#    current, and starts it now when herdr is running.
# 3. When Tailscale runs on this PC, serves the app to your tailnet (`tailscale serve`, on the first
#    free HTTPS port) and prints the address a phone opens as a QR code (scripts/plugin.ts phone).
# 4. On a first install, mentions a GitHub star once. When the gh CLI is signed in and has not
#    starred the repository, it asks at the terminal, for 20 seconds, and stars only on "y"; it
#    never stars by itself.
#
# Run it again at any time: what is already there is kept, and step 3 is repeated.
#   HERDR_WEB_UI_REF=<branch or tag>   install that ref instead of the latest release
