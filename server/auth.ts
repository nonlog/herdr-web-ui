/**
 * Optional shared-token gate for herdr-web-ui.
 *
 * There is no user database here: the token is the whole authorization decision,
 * and whoever holds it can type into live terminals. Hence constant-time compares
 * (a length-leaking `===` is enough to guess a token over a LAN), an HttpOnly +
 * SameSite=Strict cookie so page JavaScript can never read it back, and a `Secure`
 * flag whenever the request arrived over TLS or through a TLS-terminating proxy.
 *
 * An empty token disables this gate; server/access.ts then decides by where a request comes
 * from, what Tailscale says about it, and whether it holds a paired device's cookie (the
 * helpers for that cookie live here too), and index.ts warns when a public bind address is
 * combined with neither.
