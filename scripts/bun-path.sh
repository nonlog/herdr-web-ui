# Adds the usual bun and node install places to the end of PATH, for a herdr that started with a
# bare one. Sourced by preflight.sh and with-bun.sh. The home directory's own places come before
# a version manager's shims and Homebrew, so the node found is the one an installer put in
# ~/.local/bin. WITH_BUN_EXTRA_DIRS, a list written like PATH, replaces these places.
