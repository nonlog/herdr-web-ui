 *
 * A script run on its own builds into the directory it gives. The browser lane builds once
 * (`bun scripts/demo-build.ts <dir>`, scripts/ci-browser.sh) and names that directory in
 * HERDR_DEMO_BUILD: each script of the lane then copies it instead of building the same client
 * again. The directory is made for one lane run and removed with it, so it is never older than
 * the checkout it was built from.
